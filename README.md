# geomorphic_proc
The repository to collect my R-scripts for analysing geomorphic processes distribution and rates

1) proc_distrib.R - the script provides a function to compute distribution of geomorphic processes over the flow path length raster (automatically computer from DEM).

The example of results (geomorphic processes distribution over the Djankuat stream catchment, the Greater Caucasus, Russia, the outlet - Glaciological station of MSU):

Axis X - relative flow path distance (twenty percentiles of distance), Axis Y - part of the area.
